# AwesomeProject 

AwesomeProject is a starter React Native project.  It's essentially a "Hello World" project that will display the current date and time.  

In setting up this project I used the tutorials at: 

[Setting up the development environment - React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/environment-setup)

[Installation - Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/)
